## Instructions

You have identified a gap in the social media market so you have decided to create your own
social media network.

To make your product noteworthy, you make it extreme and only allow posts
of 5 or less characters. Any posts of more than 5 characters should be
truncated to 5.

To allow your users to express themselves fully, you allow Emoji and
other Unicode.

The task is to truncate input strings to 5 characters.
